OS X Dashboard Widget for remote control of Plex clients

##Configuration

- enter your Plex server's hostname and port number in the provided fields
- click the 'Refresh Clients' button
- select the client you wish to contro from the dropdown
- click the 'Done' button, the widget will then save your preferences and flip to the control view

##Usage
- The control view has two sub-views: navigation and playback
- To toggle between the views, click the Plex logo in the upper left (sorry this isn't intuitive, haven't made pretty icons for this yet)
